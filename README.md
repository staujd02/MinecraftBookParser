# MinecraftBookParser
This java program takes a text file and outputs another text file with line breaks 
  indicating where to copy/paste into the virtual minecraft book.
  The only interface is a File Chooser GUI where the user selects the appropriate
  .txt file. A file with the name "book_[original file name]" will be generated in
  the jar file's directory.
  
  A common error is running the jar in a directory that dosen't allow file creation
  or attempted accessing of a .txt file without read permissions.
